ETH-AVAX PROOF- Intermediate- EVM - Course 
Hello everyone this is the overview of Solidity Functions and Errors
#Description
This Solidity smart contract for Ethereum offers basic functionalities such as withdrawal, deposit, and balance checking. It illustrates error handling and validation through the use of require(), revert(), and assert() statements.
#These are the requirements and usage of it 
To engage with the smart contract, you require:
A development setup for Ethereum smart contracts.
An Ethereum wallet or client like MetaMask for compiling, deploying, and interacting with the smart contract.
Instructions:

Deploy the smart contract on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible platform, utilizing Solidity compiler version 0.8.25 or newer.
Communicate with the contract via transactions, utilizing the deposit and withdraw functions with correct parameters.
Practice proper exception handling, comprehending the error messages generated by require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

#Smart Contract Details
The smart contract named MyContract contains the following operations:

deposit(address _address, uint _value): Users can deposit funds into their account using this function. It validates whether the deposited amount exceeds 100 through the require() statement. The deposited funds are then added to the user's balance. Following this, the assert() statement confirms that the balance has indeed increased by the deposited amount. If not, the transaction is rolled back with an error message.

withdraw(address _address, uint _value): This function allows users to withdraw funds from their account. It checks if the user possesses sufficient balance using require(). If the validation passes, the specified amount is deducted from the user's balance. Similar to the deposit function, the assert() statement ensures that the balance remains non-negative post-withdrawal. If it fails, the transaction is reverted with an appropriate error message.
